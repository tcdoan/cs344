Modify the mapping of work to threads to achieve to improve speedup to at about 7-8x on both views of the Mandelbrot set (if you're above 7x that's fine, don't sweat it). 
There may not use any synchronization between threads in your solution. 
We are expecting you to come up with a single work decomposition policy that will work well for all thread counts---hard coding a solution specific to each configuration is not allowed!
(Hint: There is a very simple static assignment that will achieve this goal, and no communication/synchronization among threads is necessary.). 

Describe the approach to parallelization and report the final 8-thread speedup obtained.
Now run the improved code with 16 threads. Is performance noticably greater than when running with eight threads? 
Why or why not?
